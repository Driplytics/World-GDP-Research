# World-GDP-Research
A deep dive into the publically available world GDP data, to mine some insights from the economic performance output of different nations over the years.

My Analysis is based on the most recent (1960-2020) GDP Data available at World Bank. 

**Disclaimer**: A few of the numbers here might vary from the same conducted by a different Analyst, because of the different possible metrics that could be factored in by the Analyst. Hence I am not claiming to have the Ultimate figure from my Analysis.

## My Process
1. Downloaded the Data from the world bank.
2. Cleaned up and transformd the Data.
3. Thought process and writing down possible insights I could get from the data. 
4. Built wireframes for the dashboard while noting the best ways to visualize those insights I wanted to show.
5. Went to work building each formula in modules, which when combined would derive an insight from the Data set.
6. Used the best visuals (Eg. Card visual, Area chart and Column chart) to visualize these insights. 


## Here are the insights I showed on my dashboard :
1. **Highest GDP recorded:** Each country has in the past recorded its highest GDP (which possibly might not be a recent GDP report) in one year since 1960. Eg Nigeria recorded its highest GDP in 2014.

2. **CAGR:** CAGR means Compounded Annual Growth Rate. Here I chose to calculate CAGR from the past decade (2010) which Is a more representative measure of the country's economic health.

3. **Peak GDP Growth:** shows the highest GDP growth recorded by each of the selected countries.

4. **% of the World total:** measures the country's % contribution to the World GDP based on the last GDP recorded (2020 GDP). All are shown with a card visual because each is a single concise value.

5. **GDP history:** I showed this with an area chart since it shows the historical trend in the GDP value of the observed nation.

6. **Last 10 years Growth:** here I used a column chart to show the Year on Year GDP change for the past 10 years. I removed the Data labels from the chart to just give a general view of Year on Year change since this same information can be found on the right side of the "Past 10 years GDP" table, and also to avoid clogged-up numbers on the chart.

7. **Past 10 years' GDP:** I used a table visual to show an overview of the past 10 years' GDP record and the annual change.

## Some of my Unique observations from my Analysis :
**1.** Nigeria's GDP history has been a bumpy ride all through _(with its chart history looking like a Korean mountain, lol) compared to that of the US or china that went on a smooth trajectory. I think this is a reflection of political instability._

**2.** Since 2010 China has experienced rapid Economic growth compared to the US. _With clear evidence of a 10.29% CAGR compared to the 3.81% CAGR the US recorded._

**3.**  China is the only country among the 3 that didn't experience negative GDP change in 2020 _(didn't COVID-19 affect them as well?. Chinese Government had good management of COVID)._

**4.** Nigeria hasn't been able to beat its highest GDP of $547bn recorded in 2014 _(Poor Economic conditions Since 2015 till date)._
